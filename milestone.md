我是平面设计师—夏海比比，目前在深圳一家品牌营销公司工作，我主要对版式，字体设计，品牌营销感兴趣，我不懂代码，但我很认同开源精神，所以这个博客完全开源，博客里的内容，主要是我在顺风中笑，逆风中闹。这个时代写博客的人也不多，我也不在意能输出什么，写在这里的文字只是记录，只是让自己的一部分能够活在互联网上，所以你会在这里看到一个真实透亮的人。

如果你一定想要给我留言的话，请多说好听的话，我这人心态不好，听不得不好的留言。所以如果我的内容让你很不爽，那你最好给我闭上你的嘴，退出去就好。本站的建站时间是 2019 年 2 月 16 号，在这个建站的过程得到了很多好朋友的鼓励与支持。其中对本站运行起到最大帮助的人是[Jack Yang 前端工程师](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090),每一次我心血来潮搞博客时，其本都会把这个博客搞崩溃。主要靠他来救的场子，所以他对本站来说很重要，也是本站的首席友链交换。Jack Yang也有[博客](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090)，如果你感兴趣可以过去看看，就这样。

I am a graphic designer, Rick, currently working in a brand marketing company in Shenzhen. I am primarily interested in layout, typography design, and brand marketing. Although I do not understand code, I fully endorse the open-source spirit, which is why this blog is entirely open-source. The content of my blog mainly reflects my experiences and thoughts through the ups and downs of life. 

As a blogger, I don't expect to produce any significant output or receive negative comments. Therefore, if you must leave me a message, please be kind with your words. If my content offends you, it's best to exit quietly. This blog was established on February 16th, 2019 and has received a lot of encouragement and support from good friends during the process. One person who has been most helpful in keeping this site up and running is Jack Yang, a front-end engineer. Whenever I have trouble with the site's functionality, he always comes through to help me out. He is essential to this site and serves as its chief friend-link exchange partner. [Jack Yang](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090) also has his own blog that you might be interested in checking out.
