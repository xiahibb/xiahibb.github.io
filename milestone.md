我是平面设计师—夏海比比，目前在深圳一家品牌营销公司工作，我主要对版式，字体设计，品牌营销感兴趣，我不懂代码，但我很认同开源精神，所以这个博客完全开源，博客里的内容，主要是我在顺风中笑，逆风中闹。这个时代写博客的人也不多，我也不在意能输出什么，写在这里的文字只是记录，只是让自己的一部分能够活在互联网上，所以你会在这里看到一个真实透亮的人。

如果你想要给我留言的话，请给我发邮件吧xiahibb@gmail.com。本站的建站时间是 2019 年 2 月 16 号，在这个建站的过程得到了很多好朋友的鼓励与支持。其中对本站运行起到最大帮助的人是[Jack Yang 前端工程师](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090),每一次我心血来潮搞博客时，其本都会把这个博客搞崩溃。主要靠他来救的场子，所以他对本站来说很重要，也是本站的首席友链交换。Jack Yang也有[博客](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090)，如果你感兴趣可以过去看看，就这样。

I am a graphic designer, xiahibb, currently working at a brand marketing company in Shenzhen. My primary interests lie in layout design, typography, and brand marketing. While I may not be proficient in coding, I strongly identify with the open-source spirit, which is why this blog is entirely open source.

The content on this blog mainly consists of my musings and experiences, both in fair weather and foul. In an age where blogging is becoming less common, I am not concerned about what I can produce. The words you find here are merely a record, a way to let a part of myself exist on the internet authentically. So, you'll find an unfiltered and genuine reflection of a person here.

If you'd like to leave me a message, please feel free to send an email to xiahibb@gmail.com. This website was created on February 16, 2019, and I received a lot of encouragement and support from great friends during its development. Among them, [Jack Yang, a front-end engineer](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090), played a significant role in helping this site run smoothly. Whenever I had a whim to work on my blog, he was always there to rescue it from crashing. He's vital to this site and serves as the chief link exchange partner. Jack Yang also has a [blog](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090), so feel free to check it out if you're interested. That's it.

2024 年 10 月 12 日，本博客在中止了快一年后有幸得到了业余无线电爱好者电台呼号 BG2GGH 的帮助，得已重启，新的开始...
