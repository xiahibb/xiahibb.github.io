我是平面设计师—夏海比比，目前在深圳一家品牌营销公司工作，我主要对版式，字体设计，品牌营销感兴趣，我不懂代码，但我很认同开源精神，所以这个博客完全开源，博客里的内容，主要是我在顺风中笑，逆风中闹。写博客的人也不多，我也不在意能输出什么，写在这里的文字只是记录，只是让自己的一部分能够活在互联网上，所以你会在这里看到一个真实透亮的人。

如果你一定想要给我留言的话，请多说好听的话，我这人心态不好，听不得不好看的留言。所以如果我的内容让你很不爽，那你最好给我闭上你的嘴，退出去就好。本站的建站时间是2019年2年16号，在这个建站的过程得到了很多好朋友的鼓励与支持。其中对本站运行起到最大帮助的人是[Jack Yang 前端工程师](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090),每一次我心血来潮想要来搞博客里，其本都会把这个博客给搞崩溃。主要靠他来救的场子，所以他对本站来说很重要，也是本站的首席友链交换。Jack Yang也有[博客](http://jacklove.ddns.net:8090)，如果你感兴趣可以过去看看，就这样。

I am a graphic designer, Rick, currently working in a brand marketing company in Shenzhen. I am primarily interested in layout, typography design, and brand marketing. Although I do not understand code, I fully endorse the open-source spirit, which is why this blog is entirely open-source. The content of my blog mainly reflects my experiences and thoughts through the ups and downs of life. 

As a blogger, I don't expect to produce any significant output or receive negative comments. Therefore, if you must leave me a message, please be kind with your words.
